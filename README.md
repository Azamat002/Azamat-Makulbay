1. NEW ORDER
2. VIEW MY ORDERS

5. EXIT
SELECT ONE OF THE ACTIONS:


Where a customer can add a new product to their cart, get a list of their orders, and leave reviews and comments about the product.

After the client chooses the FIRST line (New Order), the compiler displays the names of the goods that are on the screen at the moment. The store has 20 different operating systems such as windows, linux, solaris, Microsoft Office, Oracle and others. After that, the client selects one of the operating systems, then writes the number of products.

After these operations, the client exits the compiler, if the client wants to perform another operation, then re-runs the program.

The project contains three large classes: SoftwareStore, Settings, database.
 The SoftwareStore class is the main class of the project, it is like the Main class.

The project is linked to PostgreSQL.
PostgreSQL created 8 tables like cart, member, product, producttype, rating, comments, transactions
